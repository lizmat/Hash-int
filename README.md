NAME
====

Hash::int - provide a hash with native integer keys

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Hash::int;

my %hash is Hash::int = 42 => "foo", 666 => "bar";
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Hash::int is module that provides the `Hash::int` class to be applied to the initialization of an Associative, making it limit the keys to native integers that fit the `int` type. This allows this module to take some shortcuts, making it up to **7x** as fast as a normal hash.
